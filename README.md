# Machine Learning

Andrew Ng Introduction to Machine Learning Course from Coursera.
---
This are the assignments of the course, but not done using Matlab/Octave, done using Python and Numpy for adapting to the PyTroch environment for large machine learning development projects. Also, I should mention that this course assignment and this repo can be used as a very good playground for cs231n Deep Learning for Computer Vision Course.
